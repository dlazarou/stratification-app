# Plan

## Proof of Concept

### Done

- web form to upload a CSV file, count lines, report in the GUI
- button that calls python that ends with user being able to download the file contents generated by python

### Still to do

- try the pyinstaller thing

## Initial steps

- initial web form
    - web form with upload file elements
        - categories.csv
        - person list.csv
    - div to put output info in
    - download result button ... ?
- try the pyinstaller thing

## Later ideas

- start by uploading the file and doing basic sanity checks on each file, button to actually do the work
- handle xlsx, xls, ods and csv
